# Ideas for Future Improvements to Jacaranda

## Performance & Optimization

1. **Memoization for style functions**: Implement React.memo or useMemo in the styled components to prevent unnecessary recalculations when props haven't changed.

2. **Style caching system**: Cache resolved styles based on input parameters to avoid redundant style calculations, especially for complex compound variants.

3. **Lazy evaluation**: Only resolve token references when they're actually used rather than upfront.

## Enhanced Features

1. **Media queries support**: Add responsive styling capabilities similar to how frameworks like Tailwind handle breakpoints.

2. **Platform-specific styling**: Add built-in utilities for platform-specific styles (iOS vs Android).

3. **Animation integration**: Built-in support for React Native Animated or Reanimated libraries.

4. **Theme switching**: Add support for light/dark mode or custom themes with smooth transitions.

## Developer Experience

1. **TypeScript improvements**:

   - Better autocomplete for token references
   - Stricter type checking for style properties
   - Improved error messages for invalid token references

## Testing & Tooling

1. **Snapshot testing utilities**: Dedicated utilities to make testing styled components easier.

2. **Bundle size optimization**: Tree-shaking improvements and smaller runtime for production.

## Ecosystem

1. **Preset component library**: A collection of pre-styled, accessible components built with Jacaranda.
